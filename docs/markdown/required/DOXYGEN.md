## Doxygen

GridPACK uses [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org/) to help document code. It's use
is optional. [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org/) documentation can optionally be
prepared during the build process.  This is enabled if
[Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org/)
is found.  [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/) is necessary for full
documentation features.

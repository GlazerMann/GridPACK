If you are downloading the source code for GridPACK then you will need to build both the GridPACK
framework and the related libraries. Information on how to do this can be found
on the [Building GridPACK from Scratch](DUMMY.md) page.

Release notes for GridPACK are available for each GridPACK release on the
release page. Go to
the [GridPACK release page](https://github.com/GridOPTICS/GridPACK/releases) and
click on the link GridPACK-X.X.tar.gz to download the GridPACK release.
